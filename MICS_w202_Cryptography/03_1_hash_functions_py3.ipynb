    "Hash Functions take a variable size input and yield a fixed size output. They are efficient to compute.  They are pseudo-random, that is, they mix up inputs well. The same input always yields the same output.\n",

    "For this breakout, we will run all of the available hash functions in SageMath / Python for various examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MD5 - 128 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "* SHA1 - 160 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "* SHA224 - 224 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "* SHA256 - 256 bits - the most commonly used hash today - note that 256 bits matches the size of AES256 key, so it is common to put a AES256 key through SHA256 before using AES256. SHA256 is also the current smallest hash recommended for Rabin Signatures, which we will study later today.\n",

    "* SHA384 - 384 bits\n",
    "\n",
    "* SHA512 - 512 - becoming more commonly used in place of SHA256\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of our examples below, we will see that hashes always produce the same size output, and that hashing the same input always yeilds the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see examples of single character, a change of a single character producing vastly different hashes, a short string, and a paragraph from a novel.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will change a single character in a paragraph from a novel and see that all the hashes are vastly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking this same concept to higher levels, we can calculate a hash of files of mutliple gigabytes, multiple terabytes, etc. in size and if a single byte is changed, the hash will not be the same.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For digital signatures, since we cannot sign large files directly, we take a hash of the file, and then create a digital signature based on the hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later today, we will be using SHA256 hashes as part of our Rabin Signatures."
