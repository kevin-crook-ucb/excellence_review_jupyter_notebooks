    "In the last breakout, we saw how to find the square root in modulo prime.  We saw that square roots exist exactly 50% of the time for non-zero integers in modulo prime.  We also saw that square roots in modulo prime have a symmetrical pattern.  The lower half are expressed as positive numbers, while the upper half can be expressed as either a positive or negative number.  We also saw that each lower square root, if negated, matches an upper root.\n",

    "In RSA, we used the n as the product of two prime numbers p and q, n = pq.  We saw that factoring has exponential computational complexity, and is computationally intractible for large values of n.  \n",

    "In the next breakout, we will cover Rabin Signatures, which use square roots in modulo n, where n is the product of two prime numers, n = pq.  \n",

    "In this breakout, we want to prepare ourselves, we will study:\n",
    "\n",
    "* finding the square roots of a product of two prime numbers in modulo prime using brute force, using the same method as the previous breakout\n",
    "\n",
    "* we will see that we only find roots approximately 15% of the time compared to the exact 50% in pure modulo prime\n",
    "\n",
    "*  integers relatively prime to n will not have square roots modulo n\n",
    "\n",
    "* we will see that if square roots exist, we always have exactly 4 square roots.  this should be intuitive, as we know p has 2 roots and q has 2 roots, so n = pq should have 4 roots\n",
    "\n",
    "* if we know 1 of the 4 square roots, and we know p and q, we can recover the other 3 roots.  We take the one root and write it using a formula in the CRT notation.  We solve the CRT notation as 4 systems of simultaneous linear congruences, and this gives us all 4 roots, so we recover the other 3 roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* since p and q are kept secret, and we must know p and q to recover the other 3 roots, it should be intuitive as another example of how factoring is related to finding square roots.  If we can factor, we can find square roots.  If we can find square roots, we can factor.  So finding square roots is the same level of computational intractibility, and the same level of security, as factoring.  \n",
